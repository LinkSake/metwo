      <title>Report: Proyecto Hail Mary by Andy Weir</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I finished &lt;em&gt;Project Hail Mary&lt;/em&gt; by Andy Weir, and I felt like writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The premise is simple: a man wakes up on a spaceship with no memory of who he is or what he’s doing there. He’s alone, his crewmates are dead, and little by little, he realizes that his mission is to save humanity. The story follows a progressive discovery format, where both the character and the reader figure things out together. Amnesia as a narrative device can be a cliché if used poorly, but here it works because it gives the story a really engaging pace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I really liked is that the protagonist isn’t your typical sci-fi hero. He’s not the brave, perfect astronaut who already knows everything. He’s just a regular guy facing an extraordinary situation with the only thing he has—his scientific knowledge. It reminded me a lot of The Martian (well, I’ve only seen the movie, but it feels like the same kind of protagonist). This is sci-fi that doesn’t try to be overly philosophical or groundbreaking; it just wants to entertain you and make everything feel like it could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the science, Andy Weir has an impressive ability to explain complex concepts without making them feel heavy. It’s not hard sci-fi in the traditional sense, but there’s enough technical detail to make everything seem realistic. From the problem threatening humanity to the space travel solutions and the way the protagonist overcomes each obstacle, everything is packed with scientific explanations that make the story feel believable without making you feel like you’re sitting in a physics lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s also an interesting twist in the plot that I don’t want to spoil too much, but it involves the discovery of a new form of intelligent life. What I liked is that it’s not the typical humanoid alien you can communicate with right away. The way that relationship develops is one of the book’s strongest aspects and adds an extra layer of originality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I had to mention something that might not work for everyone, it’s the protagonist. Not everyone is going to like him. He has a lot of energy, a lot of internal monologue, and a sense of humor that might feel repetitive if you don’t click with it. It didn’t bother me, but I can see how it might not be for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think the book has a particularly deep message. It’s not one of those stories that make you question existence or rethink the future of humanity. It does touch on themes like global cooperation, the importance of science, and sacrifice, but never in a very profound way. And I don’t think that’s a problem. Not every book has to change your life—some just need to be fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for who I’d recommend it to, I think it’s perfect for someone who enjoys sci-fi but doesn’t want to dive into something as dense as Foundation or Dune. It’s a fast-paced, easy-to-read book with solid science and a gripping rhythm. If you like stories that include a lot of scientific explanations but don’t feel like a technical manual, this book is for you. On the other hand, if you find detailed scientific explanations boring, this might not be the best choice, since Andy Weir dedicates a lot of space to breaking down how things work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d definitely read it again. Not because it has hidden mysteries that require a second read, but simply because I enjoyed it enough to want to relive the experience in a few years when I’ve forgotten some details. It also made me want to read &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Artemis&lt;/em&gt;, so those are probably next on my list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Goodbye Nextra, hello Hugo</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2024/07/31/goodbye-nextra-hello-hugo/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2024/07/31/goodbye-nextra-hello-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog has been abandoned for years at this point. Since I stopped writing on &lt;a href=&#34;https://aviyel.com&#34;&gt;Aviyel&lt;/a&gt;, I haven’t done anything very technical, and for more personal writings, I&amp;rsquo;ve been advised not to publish them online as freely as I used to, because some submissions consider a story &amp;ldquo;published&amp;rdquo; if it’s available on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;ve lost interest in the topic during these years; quite the opposite. Thanks to Hacker News and Mastodon, I’ve discovered a bunch of blogs that I love and that have inspired me for the next stage of my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-big-static-site-generator-change&#34;&gt;The Big Static Site Generator Change&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previously, my website used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shuding/nextra&#34;&gt;Nextra&lt;/a&gt; and was hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/&#34;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt;. Honestly, this combo made development and deployment very easy, as well as adding my custom domain. But since I adopted Nextra in a very early stage, customization was minimal. Now it seems more focused on project documentation pages, and the style can be changed through &lt;a href=&#34;https://tailwindcss.com/&#34;&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; helpers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even so, during my inactive time, I came across Hugo and started playing around with it. I created several test projects with different themes and goals as practice, and while Hugo has many advantages in terms of speed for generating the website thanks to being built in Go, what caught my attention was the number of pre-made themes and how easy they are to customize. From simple things like colors or other styles via a CSS file to being able to modify essential parts of the theme like headers, the navbar, and the RSS feed. I finally settled on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/goodroot/hugo-classic&#34;&gt;hugo-classic&lt;/a&gt; theme with modifications to everything mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For hosting, I switched from Vercel to GitHub Pages for the convenience of having everything related to the blog in one place. The domain migration wasn&amp;rsquo;t complex but had its details—nothing that deleting all the records in &lt;a href=&#34;https://porkbun.com/&#34;&gt;Porkbun&lt;/a&gt; and adding them again couldn’t fix. On the other hand, deployment was more complex. Hugo has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#prose&#34;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; in its documentation on how to deploy through an action, but in my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s incomplete. It misses things like ensuring to include the git submodule if using a theme, among other small tweaks you might need. As of writing this, the site is free of these types of errors, although there are still some style issues on mobile screens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, despite the multiple attempts it took to get the site up correctly, I’m very happy with the new setup and recommend it to anyone thinking of following this path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-blog-organization-and-philosophy&#34;&gt;The New Blog Organization and Philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first created the website, I didn’t have much experience reading or following other people’s blogs, so I structured it as best I could. Now things have changed; I know what I like and don’t like, what and how to share.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For now, the layout of the pages will be as follows. Since the main focus of the site is as a blog, the most extensive section will be the writings. Although the RSS feed will group all posts in one place, I didn’t want them to live like that on the site. Blogposts will be for these types of things—simply writings into the void of the internet. Articles are for guides and more technical stuff. Reviews are for writing about movies, books, games, etc. Finally, Works are for my published pieces, though at the moment there’s only one, I hope it will be one of the most extensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Outside of the writings, Projects is a showcase of my work, like a small CV of my online footprint. About Me is, well, a short biography, and finally, The Garden is something strange and complex, but basically, it’s where everything else lives. Honestly, it’s the best section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the index, I also list what I’m “doing”—what I’m playing, reading, listening to, and watching. It’s just a way to share what I’m passionate about at the moment, with the hope that many of those bullet points will turn into reviews. It also has my latest readings, articles that I find interesting to share and/or comment on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for the blog’s philosophy, specifically with the &amp;ldquo;blogposts,&amp;rdquo; I want to write more. I want to capture the spirit of the blogs I follow with how they share things, without necessarily writing essays or technical guides. I’d also like to write more reviews, share my notes, my favorite quotes. Stop consuming without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I want the page to be an excuse to keep writing and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-difference-with-social-media&#34;&gt;The Difference with Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m doing this because I no longer enjoy social media as much as I used to. What was once Twitter has fragmented, Facebook and Instagram have a horrible feed full of ads. Really, where I spend my time now is YouTube and TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Besides the fact that it’s just not the same anymore, knowing that all my contacts see what I publish in their feed has made me hesitant to post. Here, it’s still public; I can keep sharing the things I’m passionate about without the certainty that everyone will see it. Everyone &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; see it, but no one is forced to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post was just to share these thoughts, document the change this page has gone through—a rant and monologue into the air. I don’t have a real conclusion, so I’ll leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dropdowns and Toggles with Pure CSS</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2022/11/05/dropdowns-and-toggles-with-css/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We could imagine the technologies of the platform on which I work, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joinbuildit.com/&#34;&gt;Build It&lt;/a&gt;, as a dish; where Ruby on Rails is our main dish but is accompanied by a good portion of JavaScript through &lt;a href=&#34;https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/&#34;&gt;Stimulus JS&lt;/a&gt;, and while this brings the functionality and that magical feeling of a single page application (SPA), there are things we want to keep simple instead of using a sledgehammer to kill an ant, as a university professor used to say. Therefore, we decided to take a page from &lt;a href=&#34;https://apple.com/mx&#34;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; when handling dropdown menus or dropdowns and do it through pure CSS and HTML; without requiring a line of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pillars&#34;&gt;The Pillars&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our two pillars in the view will be &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements of checkbox type and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. We will form our basic skeleton as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;toggle&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;checkbox&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;toggle&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be using the checked property of checkbox-type inputs to control the content we show and when we show it. For this, we will be relying on the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element since by linking it through its &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; property it will also be affected by the class change when the checked property of our checkbox is present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All our code will really be inside &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in two sections: container and toggle as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;toggle&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;checkbox&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;toggle&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

   &lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- The element with which the user will interact --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;container&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- What we want to show--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-magic&#34;&gt;The Magic&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our HTML skeleton ready, it&amp;rsquo;s time to add the CSS that will give our component the magical touch:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;

{&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ef9f76&#34;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e5c890&#34;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ef9f76&#34;&gt;none&lt;/span&gt;;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;#&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ef9f76&#34;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8caaee;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;checked&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;label&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e5c890&#34;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; { &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ef9f76&#34;&gt;inherit&lt;/span&gt;; &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our input with the toggle id will never be shown so that we do not have the checkbox present on our page, what we will show and with which the user interacts is what is inside our div with toggle class. Once they click on our toggle, the input will have the value of checked and with &lt;code&gt;#toggle:checked+label&lt;/code&gt; we affect the style of our &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;label&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to obtain a result like the following&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/dropdowns-toggle-css-1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Demo 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And with a little more style (courtesy of Thulio Philipe) we can have results like this&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/dropdowns-toggle-css-2.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Demo 2&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or as the examples we have inside Build It&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/dropdowns-toggle-css-3.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Demo 3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small popover that is always present, giving vital information to the user&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/dropdowns-toggle-css-4.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Demo 4&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or a filter menu that can be shown easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we can see, modern CSS allows us to make interactive pages without the need for a script for it; giving us a new solution to a problem with endless ways to solve it, so it will be necessary to consider the needs of the project and what is most suitable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I leave you &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LinkSake/toggle-dropdown-css&#34;&gt;a repository&lt;/a&gt; with a couple of examples seen in this article for future reference and I invite you to visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joinbuildit.com/early_access/client&#34;&gt;the platform&lt;/a&gt; and especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joinbuildit.com/u/luis-ortega-160&#34;&gt;my profile&lt;/a&gt;, where we can connect for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best traits of humankind is its curiosity. It is so human that in honor of it we named a Mars rover &amp;ldquo;Curiosity&amp;rdquo; in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Talking about curiosity in the developer world, open source projects top the list, since by nature they invite us to experiment, modify and share what else we can do with them. This is why I propose to think a little outside the box with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docz.site/&#34;&gt;Docz&lt;/a&gt; - a software documentation tool that is completely open source.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-docz&#34;&gt;What is Docz?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Docz is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/&#34;&gt;Gatsby-based&lt;/a&gt; project that simplifies the process of documenting other projects without worrying about configuration, speed and support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It provides a library that allows you to write MDX pages instead of HTML or JSX files, handles the routing and provides plugins for all the other needs that you may have. All of this results on projects anyone can contribute to!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this simplicity and friendliness that makes Docz a great option for more than just docs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-our-docz-project&#34;&gt;Creating our Docz project&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we can jump into Docz, there are some prerequisites that you will need have in order to create the project:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#overview&#34;&gt;NodeJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install&#34;&gt;Yarn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#overview&#34;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the prerequisites, let’s start by creating a new React app with &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; (CRA)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to your terminal and run:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;npx create-react-app my-resume&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have CRA installed, npm will ask you if it’s okay to install &lt;code&gt;create-react-app&lt;/code&gt; type &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to continue and let CRA create the new project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are using the command &lt;code&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; since we want to execute a package, not install it to a project. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50605219/difference-between-npx-and-npm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now lets move to the directory of our project and install Docz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; my-resume&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn add docz &lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# or npm install docz&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then let’s remove everything that CRA created for us inside the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; folder, since we don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;rm src/*&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it is a good idea to add to the .gitignore the .docz folder since we only needed for development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-.gitignore&#34; data-lang=&#34;.gitignore&#34;&gt;# .gitignore&#xA;&#xA;# Docz generated files&#xA;.docz/&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go and create a file named &lt;code&gt;index.mdx&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;hello world&lt;/em&gt; header in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mdx&#34; data-lang=&#34;mdx&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- src/index.mdx --&amp;gt;&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;name: Hello World&#xA;route: /&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;# Hello world from Docz!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s time to run our development server to see what we have just created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn docz dev &lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# or npm run docz dev&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you get an error &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/19922&#34;&gt;ERROR #98123&lt;/a&gt; while trying to run the development server, just delete your &lt;code&gt;yarn.lock&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;package-json.lock&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder and install the dependencies again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Et voila!&lt;/em&gt; We have successfully created our Docz project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/cv-docz-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hello from Docz&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to commit your files!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-time-to-shine&#34;&gt;Your time to shine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before we start adding more pages, let’s create a configuration file named &lt;code&gt;doczrc.js&lt;/code&gt; on the root of our project. This will help us to set some meta tags easily, but it manages &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docz.site/docs/project-configuration&#34;&gt;all the configuration&lt;/a&gt; of our project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;// doczrc.js&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  title&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Luis Angel Ortega&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  description&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello, I&amp;#39;m Luis Angel and this is my resume made with Docz!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ignore&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;README.md&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;]&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title key will set the suffix for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp&#34;&gt;title tag&lt;/a&gt; and it will change the text on the top left corner of our project, since it’s an online resume I recommend using your name in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, the description key that we added will modify the &lt;a href=&#34;https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description&#34;&gt;meta description tag&lt;/a&gt; on our webpage to display it when it’s looked up or shared online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last key will tell Docz to ignore some files and don’t display them on the webpage, as is in this case with the README file.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s add more pages! I’ll add a contact page with my socials and resume one in the following way&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mdx&#34; data-lang=&#34;mdx&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- src/contact.mdx --&amp;gt;&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;name: Contact&#xA;route: /contact&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;# Contact me! 🗣&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;Let&amp;#39;s talk!

Adding a custom component&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s focus on our &lt;code&gt;index.mdx&lt;/code&gt; file. Let’s change it’s title to &amp;ldquo;About me&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-mdx&#34; data-lang=&#34;mdx&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- src/index.mdx --&amp;gt;&#xA;---&#xA;name: About me&#xA;route: /&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;# Hello world from Docz!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, create a &lt;code&gt;components&lt;/code&gt; folder inside of the &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt; directory.

alt=&#34;Welcome page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-alive-time-to-deploy&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s alive! Time to deploy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ow that we have our Docz project it’s time to build it and deploy it to GitHub Pages (since we already have the repository there).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First we need to configure some things, go to your doczrc.js file and add a dest key with the value “/docs” and a base key the name of your repo as it’s value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;// doczrc.js&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; {&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  title&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Luis Angel Ortega&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  description&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello, I&amp;#39;m Luis Angel and this is my resume made with Docz!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ignore&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;README.md&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;],&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  dest&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/docs&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  base&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db;font-weight:bold&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;docz-resume&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first key is telling Docz to build the project into the docs directory, we’re doing this since GitHub Pages expects the static files to be on the root or docs directories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The base key is changing the base folder to match the name of the repo in order to make the public files and links to work in GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once we have everything correctly configured, we need to build the project with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn docz build &lt;span style=&#34;color:#737994;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;# or npm run docz build&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it is done, you will see a docs folder on your project. Commit and push everything to your repo. After that, let’s go to the settings tab on your project and in the left menu go to the Pages section.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/cv-docz-5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Repo page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/cv-docz-6.png&#34; alt=&#34;Settings page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then select your main branch (or the branch on which you are working on) and select the docs folder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/cv-docz-7.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pages page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that is it! In a few minutes your website should be live on the link that GitHub has given you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/cv-docz-8.png&#34; alt=&#34;Done!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/cv-docz-9.png&#34; alt=&#34;Handsome you&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-future-awaits&#34;&gt;The future awaits&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article we only scratched the surface of what Docz is capable of, so be sure to check their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docz.site/docs/getting-started&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to read about them to make your resume stand out from the crowd and always remember to support the creators of this amazing project and contribute if you can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Find the repo of the project &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LinkSake/docz-resume&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Docker &#43; Rails: A Solution for Your Headaches</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever spent a week just trying to run the project you just joined? Or does your application not run in production as it did locally?&#xA;There are a multitude of factors that can contribute to this, which is why &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; offers us a solution with which we can have greater control over these variables across the necessary computers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that said, in this article we will see how to make our lives easier by having our entire Ruby on Rails application running on Docker; including any necessary databases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To follow this guide, you will need to have &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/&#34;&gt;Docker installed&lt;/a&gt; as well as a project you want to &lt;em&gt;dockerize&lt;/em&gt;. If you just want to practice, you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LinkSake/docker-rails&#34;&gt;this example project&lt;/a&gt; which requires a connection to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL&#34;&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis&#34;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt; to function.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you impatient? You can clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LinkSake/docker-rails/tree/docker&#34;&gt;this branch&lt;/a&gt; of the project where the necessary files to run the project inside Docker are already present!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-comes-the-dockerfile&#34;&gt;First Comes the Dockerfile&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we will do is create a custom &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects&#34;&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; for our project, so we will create a file at the root of it called &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;touch Dockerfile&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first line of our file will define the image we will base on, in this case, it will be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby&#34;&gt;official Ruby image&lt;/a&gt;, but we will use the Alpine version to have a lighter image as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Dockerfile&#34; data-lang=&#34;Dockerfile&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt; ruby:3.0.1-alpine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e78284&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Make sure the Ruby version (ruby:X.X.X-alpine) is the same as in your project, or you will have errors when trying to build the image. You can find the version used by your project in your Gemfile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next comes the most difficult part of this Dockerfile, installing the necessary dependencies for the project to function;

If we build our image with &lt;code&gt;docker build .&lt;/code&gt; and try to run it with &lt;code&gt;docker start docker-rails&lt;/code&gt; we would encounter an error, since Rails does not find the databases it needs to start correctly; but we will soon take care of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;then-the-docker-composeyml&#34;&gt;Then the docker-compose.yml&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To coordinate all the services we need for the correct functioning of our application (in this case 2 databases: Postgres and Redis) we will use &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/&#34;&gt;docker-compose&lt;/a&gt;, this Docker utility will help us create multiple containers from different images, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/&#34;&gt;connect them&lt;/a&gt;, give them &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/&#34;&gt;environment variables&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/&#34;&gt;volumes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will start by creating a file called &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;touch docker-compose.yml&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on its first line we will specify which &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#compose-and-docker-compatibility-matrix&#34;&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; of the tool we want to use, in this case we will use the most recent at the time of writing this article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ca9ee6&#34;&gt;version&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;3.8&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we will indicate the services we want docker-compose to run, we will do this under the &lt;code&gt;services&lt;/code&gt; label. We will give each service a name, which will be important when we are configuring our image, so make sure to name it in a way that makes sense to you. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the Postgres service, which we will call &lt;em&gt;db&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;

tag is the name we gave to the service and within which we will specify all the configuration for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we encounter is &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt;, which as its name indicates is the name of the image we want to use for that service, in this case it is the official Postgres image in its latest version (you can specify a version by replacing &lt;code&gt;latest&lt;/code&gt; with another valid version).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then we encounter &lt;code&gt;container_name&lt;/code&gt;, which is also self-explanatory and which will come in handy when checking our containers with &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;environment&lt;/code&gt; refers to the environment variables, and if we refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres&#34;&gt;Docker Postgres image documentation&lt;/a&gt; we can see that the only mandatory variable is &lt;code&gt;POSTGRES_PASSWORD&lt;/code&gt; but we will also define &lt;code&gt;POSTGRES_DB&lt;/code&gt; to give a custom name to the database that the image creates by default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Be sure to choose a secure password for the database!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ports&lt;/code&gt; are the ports that we will need to pass from inside the container to our machine, the ones indicated in the file are the ones that Postgres uses by default.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;volumes&lt;/code&gt; are the persistent information we will need so as not to run the migrations every time we turn on the container, this is because Docker deletes all data once we shut down the information, if you want to learn more about this topic I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; section of the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, the next service is Redis but we will not delve much into it as it only has a couple of labels which we have already reviewed, for more information you can visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://hub.docker.com/_/redis&#34;&gt;the official image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;

since our Dockerfile is at the root we will only put &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;; if your Dockerfile is not at the root or has another name it is advisable to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#build&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; section of the documentation to make sure Compose finds it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; tag in this case will serve to name the image that Compose will build, since &lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; is present it will not go to the repository to look for a pre-built image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;code&gt;depends_on&lt;/code&gt; tag will inform Compose that it should not try to start the container until the &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;redis&lt;/code&gt; services are created, as well as it will connect them internally so that we can access them through a URL (as can be seen in the Redis environment variable) or by their respective credentials (as is the case with Postgres), if you want to learn how Docker handles this you can read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/&#34;&gt;Docker Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have finished with the services, the only thing we must do is list the volumes we will use and which we &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volumes&#34;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt;

Our &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; is ready, now there&amp;rsquo;s only one step left to start creating our Docker-contained application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;out-of-sight-dockerignore-out-of-mind&#34;&gt;Out of Sight, .dockerignore Out of Mind&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many times we do not want certain files to be in our Docker image because they are not necessary for its construction (or are generated in it) and only end up making the project larger than it needs to be, such as the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt; folder.&#xA;To save this space, we will create a file called &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt; at the root of our project and add these two folders:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#99d1db&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6d189&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;.git \n node_modules&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; .dockerignore&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on what a &lt;code&gt;.dockerignore&lt;/code&gt; file can contain, you can consult the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file&#34;&gt;official Docker documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;databases-2-go&#34;&gt;Databases 2 Go&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before running the project it will be necessary to create the database that Rails expects, and creating it is so simple that it can be done in a single command.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;docker-compose run web db:create&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command tells Docker to use the image (which it will build) to run a command, in this case &lt;code&gt;db:create&lt;/code&gt;. Docker, with what is specified in the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt;, knows that since &lt;em&gt;web&lt;/em&gt; depends on &lt;em&gt;db&lt;/em&gt; it will have to run the Postgres instance first, so the database will be created in this container.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why only &lt;code&gt;db:create&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;rails db:create&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;rake db:create&lt;/code&gt;? In our &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt; we gave &lt;code&gt;rails&lt;/code&gt; as the entry point, so only the parameters are necessary. If we wanted to perform another command inside the container this would have to be through &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/&#34;&gt;docker exec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-application-in-a-container&#34;&gt;Our Application in a Container&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the database created, there&amp;rsquo;s only one command left that will run the containers in &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/&#34;&gt;detached mode&lt;/a&gt; and we will be able to see the fruit of our labor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#c6d0f5;background-color:#303446;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;docker-compose up -d&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it! You can now access through your browser to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:3000/&#34;&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/a&gt; and see the Rails welcome page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/post/docker-rails-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Welcome to Rails!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This whole process may be a bit intimidating at first, especially if you are not familiar with Docker, but the result is a much simpler development environment for everyone involved in the project, as now just by having Docker installed they can start programming; not to mention the benefits that this technology can bring to your production environment when combined with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you found this useful, anything you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://luisangel.me/es/about&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; and I will respond as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/samples/rails/&#34;&gt;Docker Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gorails.com/episodes/docker-basics-for-gorails&#34;&gt;Go Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Home Office or No Home Office? That is the Question</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2021/04/20/the-issue-with-home-office/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 15:07:57 -0500</pubDate><author>hey@luisangel.me (Luis Angel Ortega)</author>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2021/04/20/the-issue-with-home-office/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During this past weekend, I found myself in the middle of a family conversation, where the topic of &lt;em&gt;home office&lt;/em&gt; came up. My father commented that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good practice. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not healthy,&amp;rdquo; he repeated several times while shaking his head from side to side in denial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I did not agree with him, as both of us (who, by the way, both work in the IT field) have seen huge benefits from working from home. We tried to explain, but he continued to shake his head and finally we left the conversation at that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But since then, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to stop thinking about it. Is &lt;em&gt;home office&lt;/em&gt; really healthy? Does it really have the benefits that I claim? After a couple of days of reflection, I found that this topic, like everything in life, is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have already passed the first year mark of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic&#34;&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and from my experience and privilege, &lt;em&gt;home office&lt;/em&gt; has brought a lot of benefits to my life (although here I only list 3).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-good&#34;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This situation has allowed me to have a remote job, something that while possible before, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I would have been given the opportunity so easily as a &lt;em&gt;junior&lt;/em&gt; developer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More time for myself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is the most obvious, as without having to travel (or even shower in the mornings) to go to an office I have been able to sleep more, spend more time with my family, and give myself time for me. I have been able to engage in more activities, which although are inside my house or with a limited number of people, I had not been able to try before; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how much time of my life was only going in transport to other places.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greater mental peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was the point I wanted to get to, because I believe not everyone has experienced this, but for me (after the initial shock of confinement) my mental health has improved considerably. See, I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_anxiety_disorder&#34;&gt;generalized anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt; and there are days that I am very, very bad. Those days, when I had to work in an office, were terrible. The workday seemed eternal, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I aged 4 years for each day that was like that; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t concentrate during those hours and I felt horrible about it, feeling that my work was not worth it and not sure what I was doing there. It was a time when neither my mind nor my body could escape from there, the most I could do was watch a couple of YouTube videos, talk to colleagues or go for a walk; but that was it, your colleagues can only talk so much with you before they have to return to their tasks and after a certain number of walks your boss starts to look at you weird (YouTube videos are infinite, for better or worse).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in the &lt;em&gt;home office&lt;/em&gt; I have the privilege of working from my room, where I have all the tools I need to deal with those bad days, which not only are no longer terrible, but have decreased in quantity and frequency! Although it took a couple of months to reach stability in my routine and have the discipline to work from home, now if I start having a particularly terrible day, I&amp;rsquo;ll take a quick shower, go out to the patio, and play with my pet; and that will work as a &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt; to my body, where I didn&amp;rsquo;t lose the whole day trying to escape from my own mind, instead just 20 minutes in regaining composure. On less terrible but still difficult days, stopping each &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;pomodoro&lt;/a&gt; break to walk around the house or play a game as a reward for finishing a task serves as enough incentive to keep a good mood all day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bad&#34;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that everything has been rosy, as I mentioned, it was a couple of months of work to get to this point. Also, I know I am speaking from a huge privilege, because not only was I lucky enough to have the equipment to work comfortably from home; but I had a place where to do it and a quiet environment, something that many people have not had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even so, with all my privilege, there has been a big point and an important topic throughout the pandemic: socialization.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socialization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an &amp;ldquo;adult&amp;rdquo; that I am, I am starting to notice something that I had heard from older people: when you are an adult it is difficult to make friends. And in my first job in IT the best thing I took away were the friendships I made, because they are people that to this day I frequent and talk to daily; they went from being colleagues to close friends. Talking with them I like to tell them that really that office was not an office, but really we were in a &lt;em&gt;reality show&lt;/em&gt; style &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where they recorded everything that happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While, in the jobs/internships that I had during the pandemic I was able to meet incredible people, people I consider mentors, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think that I would have a better relationship with them if I could have seen them in person more often. I also can&amp;rsquo;t deny that it is much easier to get help from someone if they are sitting next to you, even if it only serves as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging&#34;&gt;rubber duck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, I miss very much the human warmth that working in an office brought and it would be a lie if I did not say that I worry about losing the ability to make friends if this model awaited me for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, this is just one of the problems that working from home brings; I have not touched on things as important as that businesses save money if we are not physically in an office while we spend more by having to pay for the supplies we use to work without having a salary increase that reflects that saving on the part of the employer. This was not the point I wanted to touch on in this writing, but we should not take our finger off that topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-propose&#34;&gt;What I Propose&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what is the solution? What would be ideal? From my young and naive point of view, and considering that this is a solution to my specific problems; I believe that the solution would be a hybrid model, 2 days of face-to-face office and 3 days of work from home. It could work in reverse as well, but personally I prefer the first option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would allow for an agile dynamic for situations such as meetings, planning or any other type of event that benefits from being physically in a room, leaving 3 days of space for the employee to work comfortably and in their own style from home. Also, if the office is already going to be open some days, why not allow employees who want to go work there? This could benefit, for example, someone who does not have good internet at home or someone who has children at home and does not have a suitable place to concentrate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this last example it also works the other way around, it would allow (if things return to something that resembles the &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt;) for working parents to see their children more time after they get home from school, even allowing everyone to eat at the same time, at the same table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, like many of the beautiful things in life, I think everything should be left to the free will of people; that they can choose the model that works best for them, because I believe that we as humans are much more than a piece of meat capable of making money for a company and &lt;em&gt;home office&lt;/em&gt; can be a support in our search for meaning and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in more about the topic of post-covid life, I recommend this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iILrpgbAMY&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by Ophelia Pastrana.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited to share that my poem Una Cucharadita de Sol was selected as a winner in the Quarantine Poetry: Homemade Poems Competition in 2020! This piece was included in the international anthology Quarantine Poetry: 2020 Homemade Poems, where it was translated into English, French, Italian, and Indonesian. This recognition means a lot to me, as it captures a moment of reflection during an unprecedented time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get it on &lt;a href=&#34;https://payhip.com/b/aqXmV&#34;&gt;payhip.com&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/docs/quarantine-poetry.pdf&#34;&gt;mirror on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I read a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.escritas.org/es/t/4758/el-mediodia-en-la-calle-atropellando-angeles&#34;&gt;poem&lt;/a&gt; by Jaime Sabines, one of his verses said the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;    &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The best part of school is recess,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    &lt;em&gt;says Judit, and I think:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    &lt;em&gt;when will life give me a break?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    &lt;em&gt;Damn! I&amp;rsquo;m tired. I need&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;    &lt;em&gt;to die for at least a week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These words echoed in me, I also want to die for a week so that I can wake up, and more importantly maintain, the spirits and mental clarity I experience from 8:30 to 9 in the morning, while I read (the time when I read this and other poems, by the way) and listen to music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the truth is that I have been dead for more than a week, 140 days to be exact, or at least that&amp;rsquo;s how it feels. I want to go to recess, a break from this era of human history, and be able to feel euphoria for life again, not a constant fear of losing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Sunday that Lasted a Summer</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2020/07/26/the-sunday-that-lasted-a-summer/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a recurring feeling in my life. A feeling I associate with a time and a place. The feeling of a Sunday afternoon, which for some reason tastes of melancholy and even a bit of despair. As if the start of a new week signified the death of the being who lived in the week that just ended.&#xA;I have had this feeling since I can remember, at least since middle school.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I walked my dog on a Sunday afternoon, there was something about the calm and emptiness of the streets that made me uncomfortable.&#xA;At first, I feared this feeling since I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it, but by the time I was in high school, I had accepted it. I got used to it. I simply called it &lt;em&gt;the Sunday Sadness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a while I learned how to escape from it. By college I started going out with a girl, who would eventually become my girlfriend, on Sunday afternoons; one day I explained this to her and she understood.&#xA;With her, I discovered that as long as I was with company the feeling would disappear. With this, I began to appreciate the things that a Sunday afternoon brought: the beauty of the deserted streets at sunset, the distant sound of children playing in some park or the occasional &lt;a href=&#34;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerm%C3%A9s&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;kermesse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of some church celebrating something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of writing this, it has been 125 days since the pandemic caused by &lt;a href=&#34;https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19&#34;&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt; began, and I have just figured out how the quarentine makes me feel. It&amp;rsquo;s like a long Sunday afternoon, that bittersweet feeling prolonged throughout an entire summer. Just as sunset announces the end of a week and the beginning of a new one, every so often the end of the pandemic is announced with great fanfare, but so far it has not ended (nor have things improved, honestly). My family has been fortunate during this time, as we have not lost any loved ones to the disease, and the economic losses have been manageable so far; but not all of my close ones have been so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, yes, I write this because I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m back in high school. Unable to do anything to improve the situation, unable to see my friends, partner, or my family with the ease I had gotten used to. Constantly enclosed, surrounded by screens, and living &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/mitch_kapor_163583&#34;&gt;that internet metaphor&lt;/a&gt; day by day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I just look out the window at this eternal sunset, hoping soon to be able to see my grandparents again, walk hand in hand with the one I love through a park, and gather to laugh with my friends, because I simply miss them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
