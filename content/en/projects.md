Over the years I've worked on several things, most of them are in spanish but here's a list of them if you wanna check them out!

- [**startpage (repo)**](https://github.com/LinkSake/startpage): Minimal startpage based on several startpages I saw on [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/12bobou/my_first_custom_start_page/).

- [**Nerdverse (podcast | 2015 - 2016)**](https://www.ivoox.com/podcast-nerdverse_sq_f1261615_1.html): It was my first podcast, I did it as a part of a podcasting community named Estudio Geek / XLR Studio and we (some colaborators and myself) talked about comics, videogames, movies and pop culture.
- [**DimeQuien (website | 2018)**](https://linksake.github.io/DimeQuien/): A website in colaboration with [Daniel Aguilera](https://github.com/eagleera) and Wikipolitica to showcase the profile for different candidates for the local elections of that year.
- [**uwusuarios (podcast | 2021 - 2022)**](https://www.youtube.com/@uwusuarios/featured): My latest podcast where we didn't had a main theme but we talked about the topics that where on our mind. I really enjoyed my time doing this with Nessie, hopefully someday we can give it another shot.
