# welcome, friend (^０^)ノ

I'm **Luis Angel**, a Mexican developer, writer and poet from the city of Chihuahua. In the absense of joy in social media, this webpage is my effort to create and share more to the world.

Here's a quick round up of the site:

- [**Writings**](/categories): Umbrella category for all my written content.
  - [**Blogposts**](/categories/blogposts): Toughts, rants and a more personal style of post.
  - [**Articles**](/categories/articles): Guides, essays and more serious posts.
  - [**Reports**](/categories/reports): Reviews for different kinds of media.
  - [**Works**](/categories/works): Posts about my published works.
- [**Archive**](/post): A listing of all the posts on the site.
- [**Tags**](/tags): A listing of all the tags on the site.
- [**Projects**](/projects): A listing of all my projects (tech related or not).
- [**Garden**](/garden): My digital garden ([read more](https://abyss.j3s.sh/hypha/digital_abyss)).
- [**About**](/about): It's, you know, about me.

Most of the content it's available in [English](/en) and [Spanish](/es)! Hopefully someday I'll learn another language good enough to list it here.
