Today I read a [poem](https://www.escritas.org/es/t/4758/el-mediodia-en-la-calle-atropellando-angeles) by Jaime Sabines, one of his verses said the following:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*"The best part of school is recess,"*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*says Judit, and I think:*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*when will life give me a break?*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Damn! I'm tired. I need*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*to die for at least a week.*

These words echoed in me, I also want to die for a week so that I can wake up, and more importantly maintain, the spirits and mental clarity I experience from 8:30 to 9 in the morning, while I read (the time when I read this and other poems, by the way) and listen to music.

But the truth is that I have been dead for more than a week, 140 days to be exact, or at least that's how it feels. I want to go to recess, a break from this era of human history, and be able to feel euphoria for life again, not a constant fear of losing it.
