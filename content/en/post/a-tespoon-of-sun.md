I am excited to share that my poem Una Cucharadita de Sol was selected as a winner in the Quarantine Poetry: Homemade Poems Competition in 2020! This piece was included in the international anthology Quarantine Poetry: 2020 Homemade Poems, where it was translated into English, French, Italian, and Indonesian. This recognition means a lot to me, as it captures a moment of reflection during an unprecedented time.
