For more than two decades, talking about digital transformation in education has become almost mandatory. Investments are made in platforms, new methodologies are promoted, and technological advances in classrooms are celebrated. But there's a question that is rarely asked clearly: **Who are we digitalizing for?**

The enthusiasm for innovation has left out an essential element: accessibility. It's not just about whether a person has internet, but whether they can use, understand, and benefit from the available educational tools from their context. And in Mexico, that context is usually a mid-range cell phone, an intermittent mobile connection, and the absence of a computer at home.

According to INEGI data (2024), **more than 97% of internet users in the country connect from their cell phone**, while **less than 44% of households have a computer**. Additionally, the average mobile connection speed —25 Mbps— is barely sufficient for basic browsing, not for heavy platforms full of animations, embedded videos, and unnecessary visual load.

Despite this reality, we continue to promote platforms that are not designed for that majority. Tools like Genially, Canva, or even Moodle with heavy themes become an obstacle for many students. Not due to lack of interest, but because they simply **don't load** or overwhelm the device. The message is clear: if you don't have the right hardware or connection, you're out.

This isn't about rejecting technology. It's about demanding that it be designed from the perspective of the real user and not from the desktop of the designer or decision-maker. An educational platform that doesn't work offline, that doesn't adapt to small screens, or that requires expensive equipment **is not designed to include, but to exclude**.

Teachers, administrators, and developers must understand that digital transformation is not synonymous with sophistication or aesthetics. It's an opportunity to do things better, to close gaps, not to open new ones. Betting on lightweight sites, responsive design, open standards, and free software is not just a technical decision: **it's an ethical and pedagogical stance**.

In a country with such social and technological diversity, it's not enough to offer access. We must think about real, daily, situated use. As long as we don't take digital accessibility seriously, any attempt at inclusion will be just an empty promise. And the gap, far from closing, will continue to grow... loading slowly.
