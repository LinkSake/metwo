## whoami

I'm Luis Angel, a software developer and writter from Mexico. I'm a curious person, that has lead me to several things that I really enjoy like tech, films, music, videogames, literature, philosophy, gardening and gumpla. I write about a lot of those things in [the writings section](/categories) of this page, so I encoruage you to check them out.
