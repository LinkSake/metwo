I've based this page on [jes](https://abyss.j3s.sh/) definition of a digital abyss/garden: *"i leave tracings of myself in this abyss, hoping that it'll help other people. it's fragments of me"*, i just like it to call it garden since gardens are for expressing, experimenting and growth. They don't need to be meticulous care & grown, they can be a free space.

TL;DR: This is a colection of stuff; links to other people posts, books, recepies and cool things that i want to keep and share
