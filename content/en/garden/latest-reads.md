- [**How teens benefit from being able to read ‘disturbing’ books that some want to ban by Gay Ivey**](https://theconversation.com/how-teens-benefit-from-being-able-to-read-disturbing-books-that-some-want-to-ban-223533) - I really like the idea of letting students choose their lectures instead of forcing them into a pre-curated catalog. Many of my favorite books come from a pile on the teacher's desk where she just told us "choose" (read on April 25).
